LME cheet sheet

1. 
  Compute CII with lmer or ICC::ICCest
  and Design Effect with DE = 1 + (k - 1) * ICC
  k: Average number of samples in each group

2. Build naive LME model

3. Try Centerization
  cf. Shimizu Multi-Level Lecture Notes

4. Consider `Serial Correlation`
  cf. Computational Actuarial Science with R   chap.15



*1 
  ML: variance is not unbiased when sample size is low. 
  REML: LSM + ML. variance is unbiased. 

*2
  Refer Shimizu_Multi-level-modeling-Lecture_Theory-Part
  
*3
  When using ANCOVA, the number of explanatory variables become large (m - 1).
  But in LME, only 1 variable added.
  
*4
  When predicting, LME estimate posterior mean with empirical bayesian method.
