# With such a small dataset, the bootstrap confidence interval always overlap with 
# the middle band, indicating that this dataset cannot support any claims that 
# any of its variables has a meaningful effect on fuel efficiency (mpg). 
# Considering that the average bootstrapped ALE values suggest various intriguing 
# patterns, the problem is no doubt that the dataset is too smallâ€“if more data were 
# collected and analyzed, some of the patterns would probably be confirmed.
